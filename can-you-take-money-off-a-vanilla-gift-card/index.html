<p>Can You Refund Items On To Vanilla Visa Gift Card____New Project. It doesnt offer free ATM withdrawals but when you pay the ATM fee you can get out up to 940 a day. Paypal will take money from your PayPal account balance before taking money off your card so by doing this there was only 25 to be taken off the prepaid card after the 75 account balance. Seems to have worked a treat. 2 January 2018 at 124PM in Credit Cards.</p>

<p>The Vanilla Visa gift card cannot be used directly to make cash payments but you can sell it online or in person or have the money transferred to your PayPal account through the gift card. Visa gift cards do not allow you to get cash from them so the short answer is no. For example you can get cash from a Target gift card a Sephora gift card a Home Depot gift card and more. Unlike most prepaid cards gift cards are disposable and can only be used until the balance reaches zero while most prepaid cards are reloadable and can be used indefinitely. Seems to have worked a treat.</p>
